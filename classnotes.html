			<P>The first lesson was a basic intro to the web, and then got into HTML stuff.  We learned about links to stuff: links to <a href="www.udacity.com">awesome educational sites</a> and classic <a href="www.google.com">sites everyone knows</a>. Links to sweet <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbP2N1BQdYc">cat videos</a> and that sort of thing. This paragraph conveniently also shows attribute tags and both block and inline elements.

		<P>After playing with stylesheets a little, I discovered several cool things:
			<LI>There seem to be two ways to do styles, the first is specific and only applies when you exactly phrase the class name the same, for example the below will only apply to divs with "class=cooltitle":
				<PRE class="codesample">
div.cooltitle {
	color: #C60;
	background-color:#FFFFDD;
}
				</PRE>
			</LI>
			<LI>This second way seems to apply to anything with the root phrase of the class, for example the below will only apply to divs with "class=cooltitle1", "cooltitle2" or "cooltitleb":
				<PRE class="codesample">
div, .cooltitle {
	color: #C60;
	ackground-color:#FFFFDD;
}
				</PRE>
			</LI>
			<LI>This is pretty neat.  I wouldn't have dug into css quite so deeply yet but I'm stuck on a plane with no internet connection so I can't continue the lesson.  Luckily I had samples to use for inspiration.
