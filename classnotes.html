			<P>The first lesson was a basic intro to the web, and then got into HTML stuff.  We learned about links: links to <a href="http://www.udacity.com">awesome educational sites</a> and classic <a href="http://www.google.com">sites everyone knows</a>. Links to sweet <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbP2N1BQdYc">cat videos</a> and that sort of thing. This paragraph conveniently also shows attribute tags and both block and inline elements.  And of course a photo, like this sweet dragon pic.

			<H2>Second lesson</H2>

		<div>The second lesson introduced stylesheets which are pretty mindblowing and give you huge power to customize how your site looks.  The HTML defines the content and the CSS defines the form.  While everything in HTML is based on boxes, with style sheets you can really make your page look like whatever you want. I was stuck on a plane during this section so I ended up picking apart a nice cached site and stealing elements of their layout.  I learned:</div>
		<div class="bulletlist"><ul>
			<LI>CSS is cascading, with the most specific element having the most power. Structure is critical both in HTML and CSS and how they link together.</LI>
			<LI>Part of the main point of CSS is creating styles you can re-use.  Looking at "real" websites it seems there are whole hosts of standard style files called out. Laziness is essentially a virtue, sweet!</LI>
			<LI>You seem to be able to combine styles for example span class="greenttext boldtext" would make <span class="greentext boldtext">green bold text</span>:
				<PRE class="codesample">
.greentext
{
color: green;
}
.boldtext
{
font-weight: bold;
}</PRE></LI>
			<LI>Each "box" on a website has layers like an onion from the inside to the outside: content, padding, border, margin.  There are lots of rules for style inheritance but rather than pretending to remember : use the little box in "Developer Tools" to experiment.</LI>
			<LI>CODE->TEST->REFINE</LI>
